# Object-tracking-with-kalman-filter
Detection of moving objects with kmeans algorithm and its monitoring with the kalman filter


In this work, an algorithm will be developed to track moving objects using some artificial vision techniques. The general objective is to detect a moving target in a video and predict its subsequent location. The objects to be followed have specific characteristics such as fixed colors and non-variable size, with horizontal movements in the video. To achieve the proposed objective, a prior study of the state of the art was carried out in order to identify the main problems that this type of work presents. The main techniques to be used for its implementation were the combination of image processing and analysis techniques and the implementation of the Kalman filter. Parameter adjustments were made in the Kalman filter for position estimation. The conclusion of the tests to the developed algorithm shows us that the tracking of objects meets its objective in most cases as long as the parameters are adjusted for the physical characteristics of the objects, their movement and the noise of the environment that increases the error considerably.
